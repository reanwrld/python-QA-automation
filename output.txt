Declaration of Reyan Habib Heyar in Support of Form I-589
I, Reyan Habib Heyar, declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the following
statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
SECTION I: INTRODUCTION
I was born on August 30, 2003, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. I am a citizen of Ethiopia and belong to the Amhara
ethnic group. I am currently in the United States on F-1 student status, first entering on May 4, 2025.
I am applying for asylum because I fear persecution in Ethiopia due to my Amhara ethnicity. I have
experienced threats, harassment, physical harm, and discrimination, and I have a well-founded fear that I
would be targeted again by both government authorities and hostile non-state actors if I returned.
SECTION II: FAMILY BACKGROUND AND ETHNICITY
Both of my parents are Amhara. My mother was born in Woldia, Amhara Region, and my father in Addis
Ababa. Although my parents migrated to Saudi Arabia for work, I remained in Ethiopia and was raised
primarily by my grandparents and uncles. Growing up without my parents' direct protection increased my
vulnerability to ethnic targeting.
My uncle, with whom I was particularly close, was arrested in September 2023 and mistreated by Ethiopian
government security forces solely because of his Amhara ethnicity. This incident made me fear for my own
safety and demonstrated that Amhara individuals are specifically targeted and receive no protection from
authorities.
Because ethnicity in Ethiopia is widely known through family background, community ties, and official
records, my Amhara identity is easily identifiable, and I cannot conceal it.
SECTION III: EDUCATION AND PAST HARM
After completing high school in late 2022, I was assigned by the Ethiopian government to attend Jimma
University, beginning in March 2023. I had no choice in this assignment.
